-# Change Log / Release Notes
-
-## unknown (unknown)
-
-### Breaking Changes
-
-  * The cabal build no longer installs xmonad.hs, xmonad.1, and xmonad.1.html
-    as data files. The location cabal picks for chose files isn't useful as
-    standard tools like man(1) won't find them there. Instead, we rely on
-    distributors to pick up the files from the source tarball during the build
-    and to install them into proper locations where their users expect them.
-    [https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad/pull/127]
-
-### Bug Fixes
-
-  * Add support for GHC 8.6.x by providing an instance for 'MonadFail X'. A
-    side effect of that change is that our code no longer compiles with GHC
-    versions prior to 8.0.x. We could work around that, no doubt, but the
-    resulting code would require CPP and Cabal flags and whatnot. It feels more
-    reasonable to just require a moderately recent compiler instead of going
-    through all that trouble.
-
-## 0.14 (July 30, 2018)
-
-### Bug Fixes
-
-  * The state file that xmonad uses while restarting itself is now
-    removed after it is processed.  This fixes a bug that manifested
-    in several different ways:
-
-    - Names of old workspaces would be resurrected after a restart
-    - Screen sizes would be wrong after changing monitor configuration (#90)
-    - `spawnOnce` stopped working (xmonad/xmonad-contrib#155)
-    - Focus did not follow when moving between workspaces (#87)
-    - etc.
-
-  * Recover old behavior (in 0.12) when `focusFollowsMouse == True`:
-    the focus follows when the mouse enters another workspace
-    but not moving into any window.
-
-  * Compiles with GHC 8.4.1
-
-  * Restored compatability with GHC version prior to 8.0.1 by removing the
-    dependency on directory version 1.2.3.
-
-## 0.13 (February 10, 2017)
-
-### Breaking Changes
-
-  * When restarting xmonad, resume state is no longer passed to the
-    next process via the command line.  Instead, a temporary state
-    file is created and xmonad's state is serialized to that file.
-
-    When upgrading to 0.13 from a previous version, the `--resume`
-    command line option will automatically migrate to a state file.
-
-    This fixes issue #12.
-
-### Enhancements
-
-  * You can now control which directory xmonad uses for finding your
-    configuration file and which one is used for storing the compiled
-    version of your configuration.  In order of preference:
-
-      1. New environment variables.  If you want to use these ensure
-         you set the correct environment variable and also create the
-         directory it references:
-
-         - `XMONAD_CONFIG_DIR`
-         - `XMONAD_CACHE_DIR`
-         - `XMONAD_DATA_DIR`
-
-      2. The `~/.xmonad` directory.
-
-      3. XDG Base Directory Specification directories, if they exist:
-
-         - `XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xmonad`
-         - `XDG_CACHE_HOME/xmonad`
-         - `XDG_DATA_HOME/xmonad`
-
-    If none of these directories exist then one will be created using
-    the following logic: If the relevant environment variable
-    mentioned in step (1) above is set, the referent directory will be
-    created and used.  Otherwise `~/.xmonad` will be created and used.
-
-    This fixes a few issues, notably #7 and #56.
-
-  * A custom build script can be used when xmonad is given the
-    `--recompile` command line option.  If an executable named `build`
-    exists in the xmonad configuration directory it will be called
-    instead of `ghc`.  It takes one argument, the name of the
-    executable binary it must produce.
-
-    This fixes #8.  (One of two possible custom build solutions.  See
-    the next entry for another solution.)
-
-  * For users who build their xmonad configuration using tools such as
-    cabal or stack, there is another option for executing xmonad.
-
-    Instead of running the `xmonad` executable directly, arrange to
-    have your login manager run your configuration binary instead.
-    Then, in your binary, use the new `launch` command instead of
-    `xmonad`.
-
-    This will keep xmonad from using its configuration file
-    checking/compiling code and directly start the window manager
-    without `exec`ing any other binary.
-
-    See the documentation for the `launch` function in `XMonad.Main`
-    for more details.
-
-    Fixes #8.  (Second way to have a custom build environment for
-    XMonad.  See previous entry for another solution.)
-
-## 0.12 (December 14, 2015)
-
-  * Compiles with GHC 7.10.2, 7.8.4, and 7.6.3
-
-  * Use of [data-default][] allows using `def` where previously you
-    had to write `defaultConfig`, `defaultXPConfig`, etc.
-
-  * The [setlocale][] package is now used instead of a binding shipped
-    with xmonad proper allowing the use of `Main.hs` instead of
-    `Main.hsc`
-
-  * No longer encodes paths for `spawnPID`
-
-  * The default `manageHook` no longer floats Gimp windows
-
-  * Doesn't crash when there are fewer workspaces than screens
-
-  * `Query` is now an instance of `Applicative`
-
-  * Various improvements to the example configuration file

-== Configuring xmonad ==
-
-xmonad is configured by creating and editing the file:
-
-    ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs
-
-xmonad then uses settings from this file as arguments to the window manager,
-on startup. For a complete example of possible settings, see the file:
-
-    man/xmonad.hs
-
-Further examples are on the website, wiki and extension documentation.
-
-    http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Xmonad
-
-== A simple example ==
-
-Here is a basic example, which overrides the default border width,
-default terminal, and some colours. This text goes in the file
-$HOME/.xmonad/xmonad.hs :
-
-    import XMonad
-
-    main = xmonad $ def
-        { borderWidth        = 2
-        , terminal           = "urxvt"
-        , normalBorderColor  = "#cccccc"
-        , focusedBorderColor = "#cd8b00" }
-
-You can find the defaults in the file:
-
-    XMonad/Config.hs
-
-== Checking your xmonad.hs is correct ==
-
-Place this text in ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs, and then check that it is
-syntactically and type correct by loading it in the Haskell
-interpreter:
-
-    $ ghci ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs
-    GHCi, version 6.8.1: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
-    Loading package base ... linking ... done.
-    Ok, modules loaded: Main.
-
-    Prelude Main> :t main
-    main :: IO ()
-
-Ok, looks good.
-
-== Loading your configuration ==
-
-To have xmonad start using your settings, type 'mod-q'.  xmonad will
-then load this new file, and run it.  If it is unable to, the defaults
-are used.
-
-To load successfully, both 'xmonad' and 'ghc' must be in your $PATH
-environment variable.  If GHC isn't in your path, for some reason, you
-can compile the xmonad.hs file yourself:
-
-    $ cd ~/.xmonad
-    $ ghc --make xmonad.hs
-    $ ls
-    xmonad    xmonad.hi xmonad.hs xmonad.o
-
-When you hit mod-q, this newly compiled xmonad will be used.
-
-== Where are the defaults? ==
-
-The default configuration values are defined in the source file:
-
-    XMonad/Config.hs
-
-the XConfig data structure itself is defined in:
-
-    XMonad/Core.hs
-
-== Extensions ==
-
-Since the xmonad.hs file is just another Haskell module, you may import
-and use any Haskell code or libraries you wish. For example, you can use
-things from the xmonad-contrib library, or other code you write
-yourself.

-# Contributing to xmonad and xmonad-contrib
-
-## Before Creating a GitHub Issue
-
-New issue submissions should adhere to the following guidelines:
-
-  * Does your issue have to do with [xmonad][], [xmonad-contrib][], or
-    maybe even with the [X11][] library?
-
-    Please submit your issue to the **correct** GitHub repository.
-
-  * To help you figure out which repository to submit your issue to,
-    and to help us resolve the problem you are having, create the
-    smallest configuration file you can that reproduces the problem.
-
-    You may find that the [xmonad-testing][] repository is helpful in
-    reproducing the problem with a smaller configuration file.
-
-    Once you've done that please include the configuration file with
-    your GitHub issue.
-
-  * If possible, use the [xmonad-testing][] repository to test your
-    configuration with the bleeding-edge development version of xmonad
-    and xmonad-contrib.  We might have already fixed your problem.
-
-## Contributing Changes/Patches
-
-Have a change to xmonad that you want included in the next release?
-Awesome!  Here are a few things to keep in mind:
-
-  * Review the above section about creating GitHub issues.
-
-  * It's always best to talk with the community before making any
-    nontrivial changes to xmonad.  There are a couple of ways you can
-    chat with us:
-
-    - Post a message to the [mailing list][ml].
-
-    - Join the `#xmonad` IRC channel on `chat.freenode.org`.
-
-  * Continue reading this document!
-
-## Expediting Reviews and Merges
-
-Here are some tips for getting your changes merged into xmonad:
-
-  * If your changes can go into [xmonad-contrib][] instead
-    of [xmonad][], please do so.  We rarely accept new features to
-    xmonad.  (Not that we don't accept changes to xmonad, just that we
-    prefer changes to xmonad-contrib instead.)
-
-  * Change the fewest files as possible.  If it makes sense, submit a
-    completely new module to xmonad-contrib.
-
-  * Your changes should include relevant entries in the `CHANGES.md`
-    file.  Help us communicate changes to the community.
-
-  * Make sure you test your changes using the [xmonad-testing][]
-    repository.  Include a new configuration file that shows off your
-    changes if possible by creating a PR on that repository as well.
-
-  * Make sure you read the section on rebasing and squashing commits
-    below.
-
-## Rebasing and Squashing Commits
-
-Under no circumstances should you ever merge the master branch into
-your feature branch.  This makes it nearly impossible to review your
-changes and we *will not accept your PR* if you do this.
-
-Instead of merging you should rebase your changes on top of the master
-branch.  If a core team member asks you to "rebase your changes" this
-is what they are talking about.
-
-It's also helpful to squash all of your commits so that your pull
-request only contains a single commit.  Again, this makes it easier to
-review your changes and identify the changes later on in the Git
-history.
-
-### How to Rebase Your Changes
-
-The goal of rebasing is to bring recent changes from the master branch
-into your feature branch.  This often helps resolve conflicts where
-you have changed a file that also changed in a recently merged pull
-request (i.e. the `CHANGES.md` file).  Here is how you do that.
-
-  1. Make sure that you have a `git remote` configured for the main
-     repository.  I like to call this remote `upstream`:
-
-        $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad-contrib.git
-
-  2. Pull from upstream and rewrite your changes on top of master.  For
-     this to work you should not have any modified files in your
-     working directory.  Run these commands from within your feature
-     branch (the branch you are asking to be merged):
-
-        $ git fetch --all
-        $ git pull --rebase upstream master
-
-  3. If the rebase was successful you can now push your feature branch
-     back to GitHub.  You need to force the push since your commits
-     have been rewritten and have new IDs:
-
-        $ git push --force-with-lease
-
-  4. Your pull request should now be conflict-free and only contain the
-     changes that you actually made.
-
-### How to Squash Commits
-
-The goal of squashing commits is to produce a clean Git history where
-each pull request contains just one commit.
-
-  1. Use `git log` to see how many commits you are including in your
-     pull request.  (If you've already submitted your pull request you
-     can see this in the GitHub interface.)
-
-  2. Rebase all of those commits into a single commit.  Assuming you
-     want to squash the last four (4) commits into a single commit:
-
-        $ git rebase -i HEAD~4
-
-  3. Git will open your editor and display the commits you are
-     rebasing with the word "pick" in front of them.
-

-## Release Procedures
-
-When the time comes to release another version of XMonad and Contrib...
-
-  1. Create a release branch (e.g., `release-0.XX`).
-
-     This will allow you to separate the release process from main
-     development.  Changes you make on this branch will be merged back
-     into `master` as one of the last steps.
-
-  2. Update the version number in the `*.cabal` files and verify
-     dependencies and documentation.  This includes the `tested-with:`
-     field.
-
-  3. Use the [packdeps][] tool to ensure you have the dependency
-     versions correct.  If you need to update the version of a
-     dependency then you should rebuild and retest.
-
-  4. Review documentation files and make sure they are accurate:
-
-     - `README.md`
-     - `CHANGES.md`
-     - and the `example-config.hs` in the `xmonad-testing` repo
-
-  5. Generate the manpage:
-
-     * `cabal configure` with the `-fgeneratemanpage` flag
-     * Build the project
-     * Run the `generatemanpage` tool from the top level of this repo
-     * Review the man page: `man -l man/xmonad.1`
-
-  6. Tag the repository with the release version (e.g., `v0.13`)
-
-  7. Build the project tarballs (`cabal sdist`)
-
-  8. Upload the packages to Hackage (`cabal upload`)
-
-  9. Merge the release branches into `master`
-
-  10. Update the website:
-
-      * Generate and push haddocks with `xmonad-web/gen-docs.sh`
-
-      * Check that `tour.html` and `intro.html` are up to date, and
-        mention all core bindings
-
-  11. Update the topic for the IRC channel (`#xmonad`)
-
-  12. Send the `announce-0.XX.txt` file to:
-
-      - XMonad mailing list
-      - Haskell Cafe

-# xmonad: A Tiling Window Manager
-
-[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xmonad/xmonad.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xmonad/xmonad)
-
-[xmonad][] is a tiling window manager for X. Windows are arranged
-automatically to tile the screen without gaps or overlap, maximising
-screen use. Window manager features are accessible from the keyboard:
-a mouse is optional. xmonad is written, configured and extensible in
-Haskell. Custom layout algorithms, key bindings and other extensions
-may be written by the user in config files. Layouts are applied
-dynamically, and different layouts may be used on each
-workspace. Xinerama is fully supported, allowing windows to be tiled
-on several physical screens.
-
-## Quick Start
-
-  * From hackage:
-
-        cabal update
-        cabal install xmonad xmonad-contrib
-
-  * Alternatively, build from source using the following repositories:
-
-    - <https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad>
-
-    - <https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad-contrib>
-
-For the full story, read on.
-
-## Building
-
-Building is quite straightforward, and requires a basic Haskell toolchain.
-On many systems xmonad is available as a binary package in your
-package system (e.g. on Debian or Gentoo). If at all possible, use this
-in preference to a source build, as the dependency resolution will be
-simpler.
-
-We'll now walk through the complete list of toolchain dependencies.
-
-  * GHC: the Glasgow Haskell Compiler
-
-    You first need a Haskell compiler. Your distribution's package
-    system will have binaries of GHC (the Glasgow Haskell Compiler),
-    the compiler we use, so install that first. If your operating
-    system's package system doesn't provide a binary version of GHC
-    and the `cabal-install` tool, you can install both using the
-    [Haskell Platform][platform].
-
-    It shouldn't be necessary to compile GHC from source -- every common
-    system has a pre-build binary version.  However, if you want to
-    build from source, the following links will be helpful:
-
-      - GHC: <http://haskell.org/ghc/>
-
-      - Cabal: <http://haskell.org/cabal/download.html>
-
-  * X11 libraries:
-
-    Since you're building an X application, you'll need the C X11
-    library headers. On many platforms, these come pre-installed. For
-    others, such as Debian, you can get them from your package manager:
-
-        # for xmonad
-        $ apt-get install libx11-dev libxinerama-dev libxext-dev libxrandr-dev libxss-dev
-
-        # for xmonad-contrib
-        $ apt-get install libxft-dev
-
-Then build and install with:
-
-    $ cabal install
-
-## Running xmonad
-
-If you built XMonad using `cabal` then add:
-
-    exec $HOME/.cabal/bin/xmonad
-
-to the last line of your `.xsession` or `.xinitrc` file.
-
-## Configuring
-
-See the [CONFIG][] document and the [example configuration file][example-config].
-
-## XMonadContrib
-
-There are many extensions to xmonad available in the XMonadContrib
-(xmc) library. Examples include an ion3-like tabbed layout, a
-prompt/program launcher, and various other useful modules.
-XMonadContrib is available at:
-
-  * Latest release: <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib>
-
-  * Git version: <https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad-contrib>
-
-## Other Useful Programs
-
-A nicer xterm replacement, that supports resizing better:
-
-  * urxvt: <http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html>
-
-For custom status bars:
-
-  * xmobar: <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmobar>
-
-  * taffybar: <https://github.com/travitch/taffybar>
-
-  * dzen: <http://gotmor.googlepages.com/dzen>
-
-For a program dispatch menu:
-
-  * [XMonad.Prompt.Shell][xmc-prompt-shell]: (from [XMonadContrib][])
-
-  * dmenu: <http://www.suckless.org/download/>
-
-  * gmrun: (in your package system)

-== Coding guidelines for contributing to
-== xmonad and the xmonad contributed extensions
-
-* Comment every top level function (particularly exported functions), and
-  provide a type signature; use Haddock syntax in the comments.
-
-* Follow the coding style of the other modules.
-
-* Code should be compilable with -Wall -Werror -fno-warn-unused-do-bind -fwarn-tabs.
-  There should be no warnings.
-
-* Partial functions should be avoided: the window manager should not
-  crash, so do not call `error` or `undefined`
-
-* Use 4 spaces for indenting.
-
-* Any pure function added to the core should have QuickCheck properties
-  precisely defining its behavior.
-
-* New modules should identify the author, and be submitted under
-  the same license as xmonad (BSD3 license or freer).

-xmonad \- a tiling window manager
-.SH Description
-.PP
-\f[I]xmonad\f[] is a minimalist tiling window manager for X, written in
-Haskell.
-Windows are managed using automatic layout algorithms, which can be
-dynamically reconfigured.
-At any time windows are arranged so as to maximize the use of screen
-real estate.
-All features of the window manager are accessible purely from the
-keyboard: a mouse is entirely optional.
-\f[I]xmonad\f[] is configured in Haskell, and custom layout algorithms
-may be implemented by the user in config files.
-A principle of \f[I]xmonad\f[] is predictability: the user should know
-in advance precisely the window arrangement that will result from any
-action.
-.PP
-By default, \f[I]xmonad\f[] provides three layout algorithms: tall, wide
-and fullscreen.
-In tall or wide mode, windows are tiled and arranged to prevent overlap
-and maximize screen use.
-Sets of windows are grouped together on virtual screens, and each screen
-retains its own layout, which may be reconfigured dynamically.
-Multiple physical monitors are supported via Xinerama, allowing
-simultaneous display of a number of screens.
-.PP
-By utilizing the expressivity of a modern functional language with a
-rich static type system, \f[I]xmonad\f[] provides a complete, featureful
-window manager in less than 1200 lines of code, with an emphasis on
-correctness and robustness.
-Internal properties of the window manager are checked using a
-combination of static guarantees provided by the type system, and
-type\-based automated testing.
-A benefit of this is that the code is simple to understand, and easy to
-modify.
-.SH Usage
-.PP
-\f[I]xmonad\f[] places each window into a "workspace".
-Each workspace can have any number of windows, which you can cycle
-though with mod\-j and mod\-k.
-Windows are either displayed full screen, tiled horizontally, or tiled
-vertically.
-You can toggle the layout mode with mod\-space, which will cycle through
-the available modes.
-.PP
-You can switch to workspace N with mod\-N.
-For example, to switch to workspace 5, you would press mod\-5.
-Similarly, you can move the current window to another workspace with
-mod\-shift\-N.
-.PP
-When running with multiple monitors (Xinerama), each screen has exactly
-1 workspace visible.
-mod\-{w,e,r} switch the focus between screens, while shift\-mod\-{w,e,r}
-move the current window to that screen.
-When \f[I]xmonad\f[] starts, workspace 1 is on screen 1, workspace 2 is
-on screen 2, etc.
-When switching workspaces to one that is already visible, the current
-and visible workspaces are swapped.
-.SS Flags
-.PP
-xmonad has several flags which you may pass to the executable.
-These flags are:
-.PP
-\-\-recompile : Recompiles your configuration in
-\f[I]~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs\f[]
-.PP
-\-\-restart : Causes the currently running \f[I]xmonad\f[] process to
-restart
-.PP

-<h1>Name</h1>
-<p>xmonad - a tiling window manager</p>
-<h1>Description</h1>
-<p><em>xmonad</em> is a minimalist tiling window manager for X, written in Haskell. Windows are managed using automatic layout algorithms, which can be dynamically reconfigured. At any time windows are arranged so as to maximize the use of screen real estate. All features of the window manager are accessible purely from the keyboard: a mouse is entirely optional. <em>xmonad</em> is configured in Haskell, and custom layout algorithms may be implemented by the user in config files. A principle of <em>xmonad</em> is predictability: the user should know in advance precisely the window arrangement that will result from any action.</p>
-<p>By default, <em>xmonad</em> provides three layout algorithms: tall, wide and fullscreen. In tall or wide mode, windows are tiled and arranged to prevent overlap and maximize screen use. Sets of windows are grouped together on virtual screens, and each screen retains its own layout, which may be reconfigured dynamically. Multiple physical monitors are supported via Xinerama, allowing simultaneous display of a number of screens.</p>
-<p>By utilizing the expressivity of a modern functional language with a rich static type system, <em>xmonad</em> provides a complete, featureful window manager in less than 1200 lines of code, with an emphasis on correctness and robustness. Internal properties of the window manager are checked using a combination of static guarantees provided by the type system, and type-based automated testing. A benefit of this is that the code is simple to understand, and easy to modify.</p>
-<h1>Usage</h1>
-<p><em>xmonad</em> places each window into a &quot;workspace&quot;. Each workspace can have any number of windows, which you can cycle though with mod-j and mod-k. Windows are either displayed full screen, tiled horizontally, or tiled vertically. You can toggle the layout mode with mod-space, which will cycle through the available modes.</p>
-<p>You can switch to workspace N with mod-N. For example, to switch to workspace 5, you would press mod-5. Similarly, you can move the current window to another workspace with mod-shift-N.</p>
-<p>When running with multiple monitors (Xinerama), each screen has exactly 1 workspace visible. mod-{w,e,r} switch the focus between screens, while shift-mod-{w,e,r} move the current window to that screen. When <em>xmonad</em> starts, workspace 1 is on screen 1, workspace 2 is on screen 2, etc. When switching workspaces to one that is already visible, the current and visible workspaces are swapped.</p>
-<h2>Flags</h2>
-<p>xmonad has several flags which you may pass to the executable. These flags are:</p>
-<p>--recompile : Recompiles your configuration in <em>~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs</em></p>
-<p>--restart : Causes the currently running <em>xmonad</em> process to restart</p>
-<p>--replace : Replace the current window manager with xmonad</p>

-_xmonad_ is a minimalist tiling window manager for X, written in Haskell.
-Windows are managed using automatic layout algorithms, which can be
-dynamically reconfigured. At any time windows are arranged so as to
-maximize the use of screen real estate. All features of the window manager
-are accessible purely from the keyboard: a mouse is entirely optional.
-_xmonad_ is configured in Haskell, and custom layout algorithms may be
-implemented by the user in config files. A principle of _xmonad_ is
-predictability: the user should know in advance precisely the window

-#Usage
-
-_xmonad_ places each window into a "workspace". Each workspace can have
-any number of windows, which you can cycle though with mod-j and mod-k.
-Windows are either displayed full screen, tiled horizontally, or tiled
-vertically. You can toggle the layout mode with mod-space, which will cycle

-
-You can switch to workspace N with mod-N. For example, to switch to

-#Customization
-xmonad is customized in ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs, and then restarted
-with mod-q.
-
-You can find many extensions to the core feature set in the xmonad-

-##Modular Configuration
-As of _xmonad-0.9_, any additional Haskell modules may be placed in

-
-```haskell
-module XMonad.Stack.MyAdditions (function1) where
-  function1 = error "function1: Not implemented yet!"
